# OuterWildsBlackHole
Remake of the black hole shader from Outer Wild's Brittle Hollow planet

Includes a few other tech art tidbits, the atmosphere is loosely based on the atmosphere scattering article from GPU Gems (https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-ii-shading-lighting-and-shadows/chapter-16-accurate-atmospheric-scattering). It's a bit wonky and I don't think I got everything right but I like the look of it.

The planet mesh was generated in like 5 minutes using Houdini. Nice and quick : )
